# Design Leadership Skills — extended edition

A fork of [Owl-Listener/design-leadership-skills](https://github.com/Owl-Listener/design-leadership-skills) by MC Dean (MIT license, retained), extended with a seventh plugin: **design-craft**, a practitioner's definition of design craft by Brooke Katalinich (Design Director, Firefox UX).

The design-craft plugin adds: the three craft pillars, the four-layer target experience, visual refinement with a named-signals teardown method and the nine Gestalt principles, the iterative process loop, and an `/design-craft:assess-craft` command.

Install in Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add <this repo>` then `/plugin` to pick plugins.

# Design Leadership Skills Collection

> **Part of the [Designer Skills suite](https://github.com/Owl-Listener/designer-skills).**
> Install this collection and four more with one command in Claude Code:
>
> `/plugin marketplace add Owl-Listener/designer-skills`
>
> This repo still works on its own. The suite just gives everyone one front door.
